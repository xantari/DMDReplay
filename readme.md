# DMD Replay

Replays a ROM in the same sequence every time.

The motivation for this was to allow for testing DMD Colorizations and to make DMD frame sequences in a deterministic manner for the following benefits:

1. Capture DMD Dumps
2. Look for DMD Colorization anomolies
3. Allow users to submit ROM sequence play throughs for ROM's that haven't been colorized yet to quickly get a DMD Dump so that colorization artists can spend less time dumping and more time coloring
